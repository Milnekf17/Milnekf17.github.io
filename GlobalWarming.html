        <h1> Effects of global warming on oceans</h1>
            
        <p1>
            With the worlds temperature increasing the ice caps around the world are begining to melt. Along side thermal expansion, the oceans are now rising at aproximatly  3mm's per year. With the current rise of the oceans, by 2100 they would have risen by almost a metre, significantly flooding many costal cities. 
        </p1>
        <h2> </h2>
        <p2>
           The increasing amount of carbon dioxide acumliating in the Earth's atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is resulting in the acidity of earths oceans increasing due to the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide making carbonic acid. This increase in ocean acidity is resulting in coral bleeching and is causing shells to breakdown. This is due to the carbonic acid reacting with the calcium carbonate (shells) causing them to break down. 
        </p2>
        <h3> </h3>
        <p3> 
            With the mean atmospheric temperature increasing the ocean average ocean temperatures are also increasing. This is resulting in a change in weather patterns and is increasing the occurance of major weather events such as droughts and storms. The increase in Ocean temperatures is also causing coral bleaching. This is where the water warms out and the coral expel the algae that gives them the colour. While the coral isn't dead, it is under massive stress.
