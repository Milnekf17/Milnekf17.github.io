        <h1> Ocean pollution </h1>
            
        <p1>
            One of the leading threats to the ocean is pollution. In fact, over 8 million tonnes of plastic end up in our precious oceans each year. This plastic is extrememly harmful to marine species especially as the break up into micro plastics. These little bits of plastic get eaten by many marine species. This results in it getting caught up in there stomack in many cases being fatal. These small peices of plastic also commonly get stuck in gills of fish also proving fatal. In the Pacific Ocean, there is a garbage patch covering almost 620,000 sqaure miles of ocean, twice the size of texas.

        <p2> 
            Plasitc isn't he only issue when it comes to ocean pollution. Chemical pollution or contamination is also having negative affects on the ocean. These chemicals trigger massive blooms of algae that rob the water of oxygen, leaving dead zones where few marine organisms can live.
        </p2>  
            <h3> </h3>
        <p3>
            Noise pollution is also disrupting many marine species. This is due to the many mammals, like whales and dolphines rely on sounds to navigate in low visibility enviroments. The increased boating and drilling activity is disrupting migration, communication, and reproduction patterns for many marine animals.
