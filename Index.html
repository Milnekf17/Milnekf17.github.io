        <h1> Background information </h1>
            
        <p1>
            The Worlds oceans are a continuous body of salt water that covers more than 70 percent of the Earths surface. Ocean currents govern the world's weather and support a delicate yet expansive ecosystem. The sustainability of our oceans is fundemental, for the health of the plant and the quality of life we get.  
        </p1>
        <h2> </h2>
       <p2> 
           Previously it was thought that the primary source of oxygen on the planet was rainforests, especially those in the amazon. However, it is now knowm that the oceans are responisible for 70% of the worlds oxygen. That means that ever 10 breaths you take 7 of those comes from the ocean. The oxygen is produced by phytoplankton which is a microscopic plant and acts as tiny leaves. 
        </p2>
        <h3> </h3>
        <p3> The ocean is also responsible for regulating our climate. the large mass of water soaks up heats and transports the water around the world. Without this, the weather patterns would be far more extreme. The Oceans also hold 97% of the worlds water which is reponsible for absorbing huge amounts of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide.  </p3>
            <h4> </h4>
        <p4> The vast mass is the number one source of protien for over 1 billion people and accounts to 15.7% of the animal protien produced yearly. While the ocean provides a huge food source, it is currently being over fished as large portions of it is unregulated.
